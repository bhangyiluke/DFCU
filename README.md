## Preriquisites
Before we start to install anything on the server, we need to update the system packages to the latest versions available:
```
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
1. Installing Java SE 21
   In Ubuntu 24.04, the default Java development repository is set to Java 21. So, there is no need to download the repo, adding GPG keys manually. We can install Java Development Kit 21 with the following command:
   ``` 
   sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk -y
   ```
   Once installed, we can check the Java version with the command below:
   ```
   java -version
   ```
   The confirmation results will look like below
   ```
   openjdk version "21.0.4" 2024-07-16
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.4+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu224.04)
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.4+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu224.04, mixed mode, sharing)
   ```
